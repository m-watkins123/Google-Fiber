# Google-Fiber
A data analyst is using Google Fiber data to collect data about network performance, customer satisfaction, and other key metrics. The analyst is then sharing this data with stakeholders, such as Google executives, to help them make informed decisions about the future of Google Fiber.

Stage 1: Define the business problem or objective

Business problem: Google Fiber is experiencing customer churn, particularly among new subscribers.

Objective: Identify the factors contributing to customer churn and develop strategies to reduce churn.

Stage 2: Gather and understand the data

Relevant data sources:

Customer churn data: This data includes information about customers who have canceled their Google Fiber service, such as their demographics, service plans, and reasons for canceling.
Customer satisfaction surveys: This data includes feedback from customers on their experience with Google Fiber, such as their satisfaction with the service, pricing, and customer support.
Network performance metrics: This data includes information about the performance of Google Fiber's network, such as uptime, latency, and download speeds.
Tools used:

SQL: Used to query and extract data from relational databases.
Excel: Used to organize, clean, and analyze data.
Methodologies:

Data extraction: Extracting relevant data from various sources.
Data validation: Verifying the accuracy and completeness of the data.
Data transformation: Converting data into a format suitable for analysis.
Stage 3: Clean and prepare the data

Tasks:

Identify and handle missing values: Impute or remove missing values depending on their significance.
Detect and correct outliers: Identify and address extreme values that may distort the analysis.
Standardize data formats: Ensure consistent data formats across different sources.
Tools used:

Excel: Used to identify and handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
SQL: Used to perform data cleaning tasks within the database.
Methodologies:

Data cleaning techniques: Imputation, deletion, and outlier detection.
Data standardization: Ensuring consistent data formats and units.
Data quality checks: Assessing the overall quality and reliability of the data.
Stage 4: Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Tasks:

Summarize the data: Use descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and mode, to understand the central tendencies of the data.
Visualize the data: Create charts, graphs, and plots to visualize patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
Formulate hypotheses: Based on the EDA, generate hypotheses about the factors contributing to customer churn.
Tools used:

Tableau: Used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards.
Excel: Used to generate basic charts and graphs.
Methodologies:

Descriptive statistics: Summarizing the data using measures of central tendency and dispersion.
Data visualization techniques: Creating charts, graphs, and plots to reveal patterns and trends.
Hypothesis generation: Formulating tentative explanations based on the exploratory analysis.
Stage 5: Model selection and development

Model selection:

Choose appropriate statistical or machine learning models based on the type of data and the research questions.
Consider logistic regression or decision trees for predicting customer churn.
Model development:

Divide the data into training and testing sets.
Train the selected models using the training data.
Evaluate the performance of the models using the testing data.
Tools used:

Data mining software: Used to develop and train machine learning models.
Statistical software: Used to develop and evaluate logistic regression models.
Methodologies:

Model selection criteria: Considering factors such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Training and testing procedures: Splitting the data into training and testing sets to assess model performance.
Model evaluation metrics: Measuring model performance using relevant metrics, such as AUC or F1 score.
Stage 6: Analysis and interpretation of results

Tasks:

Analyze the results of the models and statistical analysis.
Identify key findings, insights, and patterns that address the research questions.
Interpret the results in the context of the business problem or objective.
Methodologies:

Statistical analysis techniques: Interpreting the coefficients of logistic regression models.
Feature importance analysis: Identifying the most influential features in predicting customer churn.
Causal inference techniques: Establishing causal relationships between factors and customer churn.
Stage 7: Communicate findings and recommendations

Tasks:

Prepare clear and concise presentations, reports, and dashboards to communicate the findings and recommendations to stakeholders.
Tailor the communication to the audience, using appropriate language, visuals, and explanations.
Address potential objections and provide justifications for the recommendations.
Tools used:

Presentation software: Used to create engaging presentations.
Reporting tools: Used to generate comprehensive reports.
Data visualization tools: Used to create effective
